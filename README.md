## Update Notes (2021/01/03)

The project is currently being worked on for better presentation. The plan is to make it available on SideQuest by the end of January. A major factor is performance optimization, for which we had to disable Post-Processing. This changes the mood of the project a lot. If you'd like to see the original version, access the `postProcessingEnabled` branch. Otherwise, refer to the `main` branch for the most recent stable version.
